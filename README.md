App Idea
Task ’N’ Go

Task Management App

Objective: Create an app for supervisors, cleaners, guards, or maintenance crews.

Problem:
- Employees often resort to social media apps like WhatsApp or Telegram to send pictures as evidence of their work.
- Some supervisors' data storage becomes full due to the influx of pictures.
- Supervisors aren't always notified by their crews about new changes or completed tasks.
- Workers frequently experience miscommunication about assigned tasks.
- Supervisors may have to manage a large number of workers.

Solution: Develop an app with two login options: one for workers (cleaners, maintenance crew) and the other for supervisors.

App's Purpose:
- Streamline storage for supervisors and employees.
- Improve media management
- Enhance communication.
- Ensure employers receive timely notifications about specific tasks, reducing reliance on social media platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram, where messages may
get buried due to the user's busyness.

Features:
(Might change or remove some)
- Capture media such as videos and pictures using the in-app camera system. 
- Store media in a cloud-based database.
- Allow downloading of media to the device.
- Include date and location information for each capture.
- Distribute tasks evenly among workers.
- Set deadlines for assigned tasks.
- Implement a notification system to alert workers of new tasks and supervisors of completed tasks.
- Include a notice or task system:
    - Supervisors can assign tasks to cleaners. Through the app, supervisors can track the progress, completion status, failure, or cancellation of tasks.
    - Supervisors can schedule and assign new tasks, making it easier to notify both supervisor and employees, including maintenance crews.
